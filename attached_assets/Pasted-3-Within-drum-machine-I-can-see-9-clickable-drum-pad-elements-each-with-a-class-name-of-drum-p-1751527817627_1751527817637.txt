3. Within #drum-machine I can see 9 clickable "drum pad" elements, each with a class name of "drum-pad", a unique id that describes the audio clip the drum pad will be set up to trigger, and an inner text that corresponds to one of the following keys on the keyboard: Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C. The drum pads MUST be in this order.
Each .drum-pad's inner text should be one of the following letters (all letters must be represented): "Q", "W", "E", "A", "S", "D", "Z", "X", "C" : expected [ 'QHeater-1', 'WHeater-2', …(7) ] to be a superset of [ 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'A', 'S', 'D', …(3) ]
AssertionError: Each .drum-pad's inner text should be one of the following letters (all letters must be represented): "Q", "W", "E", "A", "S", "D", "Z", "X", "C" : expected [ 'QHeater-1', 'WHeater-2', …(7) ] to be a superset of [ 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'A', 'S', 'D', …(3) ]

4. Within each .drum-pad, there should be an HTML5 <audio> element which has a src attribute pointing to an audio clip, a class name of "clip", and an id corresponding to the inner text of its parent .drum-pad (e.g. id="Q", id="W", id="E" etc.).
Each <audio> element should have an id equal to its parent .drum-pad's inner-text : expected 'Q' to equal 'QHeater-1'
AssertionError: Each <audio> element should have an id equal to its parent .drum-pad's inner-text : expected 'Q' to equal 'QHeater-1'
